# Economic-Mobility

** Economic mobility is the ability that an individual improves his or her economic status. It may be considered a type of social mobility, which is often measured in change in income. And economic mobility is often measured by movement between income quintiles ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility)). The average mobility in a city may depend on numbers of factors, for example, location and education. Some economists suggest that in general, economic mobility increases as the educational effectiveness increased. 

** One of the main focuses of our research is to determine whether the idea is correct or not by finding the relationship between the educational quality and the economy across the USA. Also, if there is a relationship in between, we are able to predict economic mobility based on education level.
